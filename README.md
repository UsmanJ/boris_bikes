Boris Bikes
======================

Instructions
-----

This was my first ever project. The task set was to build a system for the Boris Bikes which can accept bikes and release bikes.


Approach towards solving the challenge
--------------------------------------

In order to solve the challenge I decided on creating two classes. One for the docking station and another for the bikes.

I built the system using test-driven development to ensure that there were no bugs in the system.


Technologies used:
------
* The application was coded in Ruby
* RSpec was used in order to follow test-driven development


Installation:
------

Download a clone of this repo and run irb in your terminal when in one of the weekday folders.


Tests
------

You can check the tests by running 'rspec' in the weekday folders in terminal.
